# Project Overview: Inventory Monitoring at Distribution Centers
Robotic object movement is a common procedure in distribution facilities. Bins are used to transport items, each of which can hold several. You must create a model for this project that can count the number of objects in each bin. This kind of system can be utilised to keep track of inventory and guarantee that delivery consignments have the right number of things.

For this project, you will pull data from a database, preprocess it, and then train a machine learning model using Amazon SageMaker and appropriate machine learning engineering principles. The end-to-end machine learning engineering skills you have acquired as a part of your nanodegree will be demonstrated through this project.

# Source files
